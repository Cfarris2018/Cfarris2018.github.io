Computer programming is a great way to get into a new career track and it doesn’t require a previous skill set. Being in construction for over 15 years I was looking for an industry that would challenge me and development me a skill that will be utilized in a significant way. Software engineering is and was an answer for what I desired for many years and the journey so far has been a ride. 

As I forgo this new endeavor, my intentions to build a new network of peers and instructors are sure to happen. As the saying “it’s what you make it out to be”; I look forward to the coding World “Let’s get it!”
